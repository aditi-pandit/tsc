- [Rebecca Schlussel] Proposed Behavior Change for NaN values
    - Want more consistent behavior across all functions and types with NaN values
    - Spark, Snowflake, postgres, oracle all consider that NaNs equal one another and order is largest w.r.t. all other floating point values
    - MySQL has no NaN support
    - DB2 has two modes - no NaN support and one that matches Spark, Snowflake, etc
    - Biggest changes are that NaNs could be used as join keys and comparison operators
    - Pushing stats down to parquet files
        - Should you push NaN into file metadata (overwriting the "true" max value)?
    - Issue to be filed later this week
- [Tim Meehan] Grammar Changes
    - See issue for full details prestodb/presto#22025
    - WAP workflows (Write-Audit-Publish) needs syntax for table branching, tagging
    - Mostly applicable to table formats (Iceberg, Hudi, Delta, etc)
