# Project attendance and participation

<!-- 
The TSC bar is different from committership bar.  By becoming a committer, you have already demonstrated
technical excellence, so there's no need to demonstrate that again.  Instead, here we are asking about
your commitment to the project outside of your technical goals to the project.

The following list is meant to show evidence of dedication to the project's success outside of their technical
goals, or goals of their employer--to show evidence that the committer actually tries to help steer the project 
for the better of the broader community.
-->

### Please provide a list of your attendance to official Presto meetings, discussions in the Slack workspace, and other community events

<!-- While attending meetings is optional, it is one indicator of your commitment to the project.  If
    extenuating circumstances prevented you from attending as many as you had hoped, they should be
    called out here. -->

### Please provide a list of outreach efforts you have made on behalf of the Presto project

<!-- This should include things like talking at a conference, writing a blog post, talking with external
    parties who might be interested in Presto/general outreach, adding technical user facing documentation, 
    or contributing to a project that benefits the Presto community. -->

<!-- This may be technical in nature.  For example, adding a feature that allows Presto to integrate with
    other systems in a data lake setting, fixing a broken plugin, or creating or reviewing a new client library, 
    could be considered technical outreach, as it helps external users to adopt Presto. -->

<!-- There should be some evidence that the TSC candidate is in some way helping the community at large, either
    through technical or non-technical means. -->

### Please provide a list of examples of public designs, issues, or RFCs you have contributed to (review, author, or otherwise)

<!-- This is to show that you are helping to steer the project in a direction that benefits the community at large.
    A positive example could demonstrate commenting on RFCs, opening issues that include design documents, presenting
    designs at technical forums such as a working group or the TSC meeting, and reviewing pull requests from non-peers
    at external groups.-->

# For the TSC Chair

### Leaderboard position for the past year

Note: The leaderboard is an imperfect metric, as it doesn't capture the nuance of community interaction.  As such, it 
should not be the sole metric for TSC membership.  However, it can be a useful tool to see how active a committer is in 
the project.
